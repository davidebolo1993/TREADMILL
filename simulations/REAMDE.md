# Simulations

This folder includes a bash script for simulating small-to-large TR expansions in the FMR1 CGG motif, and a R script for plotting results. Simulations are performed using [VISOR](https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR). Performing these simulations and plotting results is as simple as running the following: 

``` bash
bash simulate.sh
Rscript plotsim.R overview.tsv tpr.tsv
```
